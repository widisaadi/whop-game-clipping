# YouTube Audience Insights

Turn a video's comment section into a read on your audience: who is showing up, what they keep asking, who your repeat fans are, which comments deserve a reply or a pin, and what is working in your niche right now.

One honest limit up front: YouTube keeps the list of who **liked** a video private (only the aggregate count is public). So the engagement signal here is **commenters**, not likers. On YouTube the comment section is the richer signal anyway: it carries the questions, the objections, and the content ideas.

## When to use

- "Who commented on my video / analyze my comments"
- "What are people asking me / what should my next video be"
- "Who are my repeat viewers"
- "What is trending in [niche] on YouTube right now"

Not for drafting a community post (use `yt-community-post-writer`) or writing a title (use `yt-title-optimizer`).

## Setup (free, optional)

The read layer uses the official **YouTube Data API v3**, which is free: enable it at `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com`, create an API key, and set `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`. Free quota is 10,000 units/day (a comments or stats call is 1 unit) which covers ~100,000 comments a day.

No key yet? Paste the comments (or a CSV export) and the skill runs the same analysis on what you give it.

## Input

- A video URL (or your channel, for a recent-videos sweep)
- Optional: the goal (content ideas / community management / competitor scan)

## Output

1. **Audience snapshot** - commenter count, top comments by likes, reply-worthy questions
2. **Themes** - the recurring questions and topics, ranked (each is a next-video candidate)
3. **Superfans** - repeat commenters across your recent videos, worth a reply by name
4. **Action list** - which comments to reply to, which to pin, which to turn into a video
5. **Niche pulse** (optional) - what is trending in your category right now

## Steps

1. **Load the comments.** Call `lib.YouTubeClient().fetch_video_comments(video_url, max_results=100, order="relevance")`. Falls back to pasted comments if no key.
2. **Rank the top comments.** Sort by like_count and reply_count. The high-like comments are what the room agrees with; the high-reply ones are where the conversation is.
3. **Extract themes.** Cluster the comments into recurring questions and topics. Each distinct question that shows up 3+ times is a content idea, name it as a potential title.
4. **Find superfans.** Pull comments across the channel's recent videos (`fetch_channel_stats` for the channel, then per-video comments) and flag authors who appear on multiple videos. These get a reply by name.
5. **Read sentiment.** Group into positive / question / critical. Critical-but-specific comments are the most useful; surface them, do not bury them.
6. **Build the action list.** For each: reply now (a real question with traction), pin (best social proof or a correction), or bank as a video idea. Route reply drafts through the relevant writer.
7. **Optional niche pulse.** `fetch_trending(region_code, category_id)` for what is currently most-popular in the category, as a format and topic scan.
8. **Deliver the report** in the Output shape above, with the raw top comments attached.

## What the read layer exposes

| Method | Returns |
|---|---|
| `fetch_video_comments(video, max_results, order)` | top-level comments: author, channel URL, text, likes, reply count, time |
| `fetch_video_stats(video)` | title, channel, views, likes, comments |
| `fetch_channel_stats(channel)` | subscribers, video count, total views (self or competitor) |
| `fetch_trending(region_code, category_id)` | most-popular videos in a niche (1 quota unit, no search cost) |

## Hard rules

Global voice rules: see root `SKILL.md` Voice rules. Additional skill-specific rules:

- Be honest that this reads **commenters, not likers** (likers are private on YouTube). Do not imply a full engager list.
- Never invent a comment, a count, or a theme. If the data is thin, say so.
- A theme is only a content idea if it actually recurs; do not promote a one-off comment to a trend.
- Respect the free quota: prefer `mostPopular` over `search` (search costs 100 units); batch comment pulls.
