# YouTube Channel Optimizer

Audit the parts of a YouTube channel page against what actually converts a
one-time video-viewer into a subscriber in 2026, then rewrite each part that
needs it. A viewer clicks through from one video to the channel page in a moment
of interest. That moment decides whether they subscribe or leave. This skill
fixes the page so the answer is subscribe.

## When to use

- User pastes their channel URL or @handle and asks for an audit
- "Rewrite my channel About", "fix my banner", "set my trailer"
- A channel with real videos but a default or empty channel page
- Any of: "optimize my YouTube channel", "channel audit", "what trailer should I set"

Not for writing a single video's title (use `yt-title-optimizer`), the video
description (use `yt-description-writer`), or the thumbnail overlay (use
`yt-thumbnail-brief`).

## Input

- Channel URL / @handle (or a screenshot of the channel home tab, signed out)
- Goal: **more subscribers** / **more views** / **authority** / **sales** - the
  trailer, About CTA, and section order change by goal
- Optional: their best-performing videos, to pick a trailer and featured video
- Note whether the channel already has 3+ playlists to lay out

## Output

1. **Scorecard** (parts, pass / needs-work / fail)
2. **Priority fixes** ranked by impact (trailer, banner, and About first)
3. **Before -> After** rewrites for each failing part
4. **Trailer + featured-video picks** with the reason for each
5. **Section-order recommendation** matched to the goal

## Steps

1. **Intake.** Collect the channel state + goal. View the channel home tab both
   **signed out** (non-subscriber sees the trailer) and as a subscriber (sees the
   featured video). The two audiences see different things; audit both.
2. **Score the parts** against the scorecard below.
3. **Fix the channel name + @handle.** Name is a real name or brand plus a
   searchable topic ("Sam Rivera - AI Tools"). The @handle is short, memorable,
   no numbers if avoidable. The name field is searchable; set it with intent.
4. **Rewrite the About + keywords.** First 2 lines carry the value prop (they show
   in the sidebar preview). Structure: who the channel is for, what they get, how
   often, one proof. Weave the real search phrases people type into natural
   sentences; do not keyword-stuff. Add business email and links.
5. **Set the channel trailer (non-subscribers).** A 30-to-90-second pitch: who you
   are, what the channel delivers, why subscribe now. This is the single highest-
   leverage slot for subscriber conversion. Not a random recent upload.
6. **Set the featured video (subscribers).** Returning subscribers see this
   instead. Use your best recent video or the one you want watched next, matched
   to the goal (a launch, a flagship, a series opener).
7. **Lay out featured sections + playlists.** Group videos into 3+ named playlists
   by topic or series, then arrange them as sections. Playlists lift session
   watch time (autoplay into the next video) and tell a new visitor what the
   channel is about at a glance. Order sections by the goal: lead with the series
   that converts, not "Uploads" by default.
8. **Order the sections.** Trailer/featured first, then the strongest playlist,
   then popular uploads. Bury generic "Recent uploads" below the curated rows.
9. **Banner check (2560x1440).** Design inside the **1235x338 centered safe area**
   so it reads on mobile and TV where the edges crop. One line of value prop +
   upload cadence ("New AI builds every Tuesday"), high contrast, not a busy
   collage. It reinforces the About, it does not repeat it.
10. **Profile picture check.** Clear face or clean logo, high contrast, recognizable
    at the small circle size it renders at across watch pages and search.
11. **Watermark + links.** Set a branded watermark (a subscribe-prompt or logo)
    that shows on every video for one-click subscribe. Add the goal-matched links
    (site / newsletter / offer) to the banner link row; one primary link wins.
12. **Deliver the before/after diff** + the one-visit test: a stranger who clicks
    through from a single video should, from the trailer + banner + About alone,
    know what they get by subscribing and want to.

## Channel scorecard

| # | Part | Pass criteria (2026) |
|---|------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Channel name + @handle** | Real name or brand + a searchable topic; @handle short and memorable, no stray numbers |
| 2 | **Banner (2560x1440)** | Value prop + cadence inside the 1235x338 mobile/TV safe area, high contrast, readable small |
| 3 | **Profile picture** | Clear face or clean logo, high contrast, recognizable at small circle size |
| 4 | **About + keywords** | First 2 lines carry the value prop; who/what/cadence/proof; real search phrases in natural sentences, no stuffing |
| 5 | **Channel trailer** | Present, 30 to 90s, a made-for-non-subscribers pitch matched to the goal, not a random upload |
| 6 | **Featured video** | Present, the best or most goal-relevant video for returning subscribers |
| 7 | **Sections + playlists** | 3+ named playlists laid out as sections, curated rows above generic uploads |
| 8 | **Section order** | Trailer/featured first, converting playlist next, "Recent uploads" buried below |
| 9 | **Watermark** | Branded subscribe-prompt watermark set on every video |
| 10 | **Links** | One goal-matched primary link in the banner row; extras only if they earn the slot |

## Hard rules

Global voice rules: see root `SKILL.md` Voice rules. Additional skill-specific
rules:

- Audit the channel page as **both** a non-subscriber (trailer) and a subscriber
  (featured video). They are two different first impressions.
- The banner must be designed inside the **1235x338 safe area** centered in the
  2560x1440 canvas. Anything outside it is cropped on mobile and TV. Never put the
  value prop near the edges.
- The trailer is the highest-leverage slot for subscriber conversion. A channel
  with no trailer leaves that slot empty; always recommend setting one.
- First 2 lines of the About carry the whole value prop (they show in the preview
  before "more"). Lead with the viewer's benefit, not a mission statement.
- Real search phrases in natural sentences. Never a comma-separated keyword dump.
- One primary link. A wall of links dilutes the click.
- At most one em dash in the About text (about one per 100 words). No "leverage", "fundamentally", "unlock".
