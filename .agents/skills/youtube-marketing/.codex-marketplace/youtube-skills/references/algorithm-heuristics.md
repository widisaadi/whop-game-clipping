## The core model: CTR x retention, optimized for satisfaction

YouTube does not rank "views". It predicts and optimizes **satisfied watch-time**
per impression. Two signals multiply:

```
expected value of an impression  ~=  P(click)  x  P(satisfied watch | click)
```

- **P(click)** is driven by the packaging: title and thumbnail. This is CTR.
- **P(satisfied watch)** is driven by retention, session time, and post-watch
  signals (the viewer comes back, subscribes, does not bounce to a competitor).

The product is what matters. A 12% CTR with 20% average view duration loses to a
6% CTR with 55% retention. You cannot fix a weak video with a strong title, and a
great video with a flat thumbnail never gets the impression to prove itself.

## Signal weights (relative reach impact)

| Signal | Relative weight | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Average view duration / % viewed (retention)** | highest | the spine of the ranker; the retention curve is read shape-by-shape |
| **Satisfied sessions** (viewer keeps watching YouTube after) | very high | session-starter videos get pushed; session-enders get throttled |
| **Click-through rate (CTR)** in context | high | half the product, but only useful paired with retention |
| **Returning viewers / subscribes from a video** | high | the closest thing to a "save"; signals the next one is wanted |
| **Watch-time per impression** | high | the combined currency the browse feed spends |
| **Likes, comments, shares** | medium | engagement confirms satisfaction; comments help suggested |
| **Negative: "Not interested", "Don't recommend channel", fast click-away** | heavy penalty | a fast bounce after a click is read as a broken promise |

Takeaway: optimize the **title and thumbnail for the honest click**, and the
**first 30 seconds (or 3 on a Short) for the retention that pays it off**. Those
two links are where this bundle spends its effort.

## The first 30 seconds (long-form)

- The retention graph almost always shows its steepest drop in the first 30
  seconds. Win it and the rest of the curve is a slope, not a cliff.
- **No intro before the hook.** Cut the logo sting, the "welcome back", the
  channel trailer. Open mid-action on the promise.
- **Restate the title's promise in your own voice** so the viewer confirms they
  are in the right place, then raise the stakes to open a loop.
- A visible drop at 0:15 to 0:30 means the open over-promised or wandered. Re-cut
  the first lines before touching anything later.

## The first 3 seconds (Shorts)

- Shorts are ranked primarily on **swipe-away rate and loop / re-watch**. The
  first frame is the whole funnel.
- **No greeting, no intro.** State the payoff or the tension on frame one, with
  on-screen text so it lands muted.
- **Design the loop.** Write the ending so it flows back into the opening line;
  loop-throughs are the strongest Shorts signal.
- Vertical 9:16, ideally under 60 seconds. A Short that holds past 100% (loops)
  outperforms a longer one that holds 70% once.

## Packaging (title + thumbnail)

- **They are one unit.** They are seen together in under a second on the home
  feed. Build them to complement, never to repeat the same words.
- **Title sweet spot is 40 to 60 chars** even though the cap is 100. Mobile and
  the sidebar truncate around 60; front-load the click-deciding words.
- **Thumbnail rules:** one clear focal point, a face with a legible emotion where
  it fits, high contrast, and at most 3 to 4 words of text that the title does
  not also say. It has to read at a 120-pixel mobile size.
- **CTR is contextual, not absolute.** A 4% CTR on a broad-appeal topic can out-
  earn a 10% CTR on a narrow one because impressions scale. Judge CTR against
  your own baseline, not a universal number.
- **A/B test packaging.** YouTube's native "Test & Compare" rotates up to three
  thumbnails and reports the winner by watch-time share. Always ship variants.

## Reach suppressors (avoid)

- **A title that over-promises** what the first 30 seconds delivers. The fast
  click-away is punished harder than a modest title would have cost you.
- **Slow intros** that bleed the opening retention.
- **Keyword-stuffed titles and tag dumps.** YouTube ranks on satisfaction, not
  keyword density. Stuffing reads as spam and does not lift search.
- **Re-used or misleading thumbnails** (a moment that is not in the video) trip
  trust and can earn manual review.
- **Posting Shorts and long-form with no through-line** so neither audience
  converts to the other. Decide the role each format plays.

## Reach amplifiers

- **A retention curve that stays flat or rises** in the middle (a re-hook or a
  payoff bump) signals a satisfying watch and earns more suggested placement.
- **Chapters** in the description help both UX and the systems that segment a
  video, and they lift the "key moments" surface in search.
- **End screens and a clear next-video** keep the session on YouTube, which the
  session signal rewards.
- **Consistent packaging style** trains your audience to recognize and click your
  thumbnails on the home feed.
- **Replying to early comments** in the first hour seeds the comment signal that
  helps suggested distribution.

## Character and format limits

| Item | Limit |
|---|---|
| Title | 100 characters (sweet spot 40 to 60) |
| Description | 5,000 characters (first ~150 visible before "Show more") |
| Tags | 500 characters combined (low ranking value in 2026; use sparingly) |
| Long-form video | up to 12 hours / 256 GB native (Publora uploads cap at 512 MB) |
| Shorts | vertical 9:16, up to 3 minutes, but under 60s performs best |
| Custom thumbnail | JPEG or PNG, max 2 MB, 1280x720 recommended, verified channel required |

## Long-form vs Shorts strategy

- **Shorts win reach; long-form wins revenue, depth, and loyal subscribers.** A
  Shorts subscriber is worth less watch-time than a long-form subscriber, so do
  not measure them with the same ruler.
- **Use Shorts as the top of the funnel** that points at the long-form library,
  and long-form as the thing that builds the relationship and the session time.
- A healthy 2026 cadence for a growing channel is reported around **1 long-form
  per week plus 3 to 5 Shorts**, but consistency beats volume. Pick a rhythm you
  can hold for 12 weeks.
- **Do not let Shorts views inflate your sense of growth.** Track long-form
  watch-time and returning viewers separately.

## Timing

| Audience | Best windows (local) |
|---|---|
| US general / education | Tue-Thu and Sat-Sun, publish 2 to 4 hours before your peak viewing window |
| Working professionals | weekday evenings 6 to 9 PM, and weekend mornings |
| Global mixed | publish so the first 24h overlaps your largest timezone's evening |

- The first 24 to 48 hours set the trajectory, but YouTube is a search-and-
  suggest platform: a good video keeps surfacing for months. Long-tail beats the
  feed-platform "active life is hours" model.
- Publish a few hours before your audience's peak so the video has data when the
  browse feed tests it.

## Pre-publish checklist

- [ ] Title under 100 chars (aim 40 to 60), click-deciding words front-loaded.
- [ ] Title and thumbnail complement each other and do not repeat words.
- [ ] Em dashes (`—`) under the cap: at most one in the title, about one per 100 words in the description (never swap one for a period); no en dashes (`–`) between clauses or double dashes (`--`).
- [ ] No AI vocabulary cluster (3+ markers in one paragraph: leverage, fundamentally, significant, etc.; any marker in a one-line title).
- [ ] At least one specific number in the title or first description line.
- [ ] First 150 chars of the description hook and carry the search phrase once.
- [ ] Chapters added if the video has clear sections.
- [ ] First 30 seconds (or 3 on a Short) restate and pay off the title's promise.
- [ ] No greeting or intro animation before the hook.
- [ ] Thumbnail reads at 120 px: one focal point, legible emotion, <= 4 words.
- [ ] End screen / next-video set to continue the session.
- [ ] The click the title earns is one the video honestly keeps.
