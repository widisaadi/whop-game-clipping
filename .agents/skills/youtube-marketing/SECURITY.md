## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue in this repository (for example: a skill
instruction that could be abused for prompt injection, a script that
mishandles credentials, or an unsafe command pattern), please report it
privately:

- **Preferred:** open a private report via
  [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/sergebulaev/youtube-skills/security/advisories/new)
- **Alternative:** email `s@bulaev.org` with subject `[SECURITY] youtube-skills`

Please include:

1. A description of the issue and where it lives (file path, skill name)
2. Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
3. The impact you believe it has

You can expect an acknowledgement within 72 hours and a fix or a public
disclosure decision within 14 days.

## Scope notes

- This bundle never ships hardcoded credentials. API tokens (YouTube Data
  API, Publora, Pixfaro) are read from environment variables or `.env` files that are
  gitignored; see `.env.example`.
- Scripts in `lib/` perform HTTP calls only to the YouTube Data API
  (`googleapis.com`), Publora and Pixfaro, and never execute shell commands
  built from remote content. There is no Apify integration in this bundle.
- Please do not test vulnerabilities against third-party services
  (YouTube, Publora, Pixfaro) outside their own disclosure programs.
